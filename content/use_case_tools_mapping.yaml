# DEPRECATED — This file is no longer used by the pipeline.
# Tool selection is now handled by fill_articles.py (AI picks tools from affiliate_tools.yaml
# based on article context). Selected tools are stored in each article's frontmatter
# (primary_tool, secondary_tool, tools_mentioned).
# This file is kept only as a historical log.

# Previous purpose: editorial mapping use case problem -> preferred tools.
