# Editorial mapping: use case problem (exact match, normalized) -> preferred tools for the article.
# Tool names must match content/affiliate_tools.yaml "name" exactly (e.g. "Opus Clip", "Descript").
# Used by generate_queue.py to set primary_tool / secondary_tool; fill_articles uses these for priority.
# When this list is empty: fill_articles still passes all tools from affiliate_tools.yaml to the model
# so it can mention 1–2 that fit the topic; render_site then turns those names into links.
# Example:
#   - problem: "automate video thumbnails creation for social media"
#     tools: "Canva, Pictory"
