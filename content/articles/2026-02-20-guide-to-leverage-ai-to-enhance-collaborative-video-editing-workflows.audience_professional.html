<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Try it yourself: Build your own AI prompt</h3>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">To create customized AI support for your video projects, follow this workflow:</p>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Human → Prompt #1 (meta-prompt to a general AI, using chain-of-thought reasoning) → AI returns Prompt #2 (ready-to-paste prompt for the specific tool) → Use Prompt #2 in the tool.</p>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Here is the input (Prompt #1) ready to use with <a href="https://www.opus.pro/?via=d9d7c5">Opus Clip</a> (AI tool).</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">**Role:** You are a professional video editing assistant specializing in collaborative projects.
**Objective:** Generate a structured prompt for automated editing suggestions based on user-provided footage.
**Chain of thought:** Think step by step: first analyze the input data, then identify key elements that need editing, and finally construct the prompt for the target AI tool.
**Output specification:** Return a clear, numbered list of editing suggestions that can be pasted directly into Descript.
**Edge cases:** 
- If the footage has varying audio quality, note it.
- If the content exceeds the maximum file size, indicate what to do instead.
**Uncertainty:** If there is no input data available, indicate so and request clarification.
**Permission:** If you need more context about the project, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.</pre>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">The AI returns the following output (Prompt #2), which is ready to use with <a href="https://www.descript.com">Descript</a> (AI-powered audio and video editing tool).</p>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">The AI returns the following output (Prompt #2), that is ready to use with <a href="https://www.opus.pro/?via=d9d7c5">Opus Clip</a> (AI tool).</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">Sure! To create effective editing suggestions, I'll need to analyze your footage. Please provide the following details:

1. **Footage Description:** What type of footage do you have? (e.g., interview, b-roll, vlog, etc.)
2. **Audio Quality:** How is the audio quality throughout the footage? Are there any noticeable fluctuations or issues?
3. **Length of Footage:** What is the total runtime of your footage? 
4. **File Size:** Is the file size within the acceptable limit for editing in Descript?
5. **Desired Outcome:** What is the final output you're aiming for? (e.g., polished video, highlight reel, etc.)

Once I have this information, I'll generate a structured list of editing suggestions for you!</pre>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Action cue: Turn insight into output—use Prompt #2 in your AI tool right away.</p>
