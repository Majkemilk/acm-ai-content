    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Try it yourself: Build your own AI prompt</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Conducting effective AI prompts is key to your editing success. The workflow is as follows:</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Human → Prompt #1 → AI returns Prompt #2 → Use Prompt #2 in the tool.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Here is the input (Prompt #1) ready to use with <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> (Claude is an AI chatbot designed to engage in conversations and assist users with various queries.).</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm"> 
**Role:** You are a senior video editing consultant specializing in collaborative workflows and AI integration.
**Objective:** Develop a robust AI prompt that utilizes AI tools to streamline video editing processes within a team.
**Task:** Please create a prompt that will assume achieving the Objective using the tools listed in the Recommended tools section, to automate the video editing feedback loop.
**Chain of thought:** Think step by step: first analyze the input video data, then identify the key feedback points necessary for the collaboration cycle, and then construct the prompt for the target tool.
**Output specification:** The output must always be Prompt #2: a ready-to-paste prompt for the chosen tool from Recommended tools. Format: copy-paste block of the prompt.
**Edge cases:** If the input video has quality issues, if the feedback data is incomplete, if the editing tools face compatibility challenges.
**Recommended tools:** Opus Clip, Descript, Canva.
**Uncertainty:** If the AI is unsure about any element, specify it and ask for clarification.
**Permission:** If context is insufficient, the AI should ask clarifying questions.
</pre>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Below is the output (Prompt #2) the AI returns, which is ready to use with Claude in the same or a new thread, or in another tool of the same type (Claude is an AI chatbot designed to engage in conversations and assist users with various queries.).</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">To create an effective AI prompt for streamlining video editing processes within a collaborative team, we will focus on leveraging the tools mentioned (Opus Clip, Descript, and Canva). Here’s a breakdown of the steps involved in constructing the prompt:

1. **Analyze Input Video Data**:
   - Identify video quality (resolution, audio clarity, etc.)
   - Detect any major issues (e.g., awkward cuts, unclear audio).

2. **Identify Key Feedback Points**:
   - Establish a checklist for common feedback categories (content clarity, pacing, graphics, etc.)
   - Determine the format for receiving feedback (text comments, timestamp annotations).

3. **Construct the Prompt**:
   - Combine the analysis and feedback processes in the prompt.
   - Ensure flexibility to handle edge cases (quality issues, incomplete feedback).

Now, here’s the ready-to-paste prompt for **Descript**, as it is well-suited for collaborative video editing and feedback integration:

```plaintext
You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a video editing project. Please perform the following steps:

1. Analyze the input video for the following quality issues:
   - Check for resolution quality (720p, 1080p, etc.)
   - Evaluate audio clarity (clear dialogue, background noise)
   - Identify any awkward cuts or transitions.

2. Provide a report on the video quality along with feedback points in these categories:
   - Content clarity: Are the messages conveyed effectively?
   - Pacing: Is the video engaging and well-timed?
   - Graphics: Are the visual elements impactful and aligned with the content?
   - Overall suggestions for improvement.

3. If quality issues are detected, suggest specific edits to enhance clarity and engagement. 

4. Collect feedback from users collaboratively, allowing them to comment at specific timestamps directly in the Descript interface.

5. In case of incomplete feedback from team members or if issues are detected, ask for clarification from the team to ensure all necessary points are addressed.

Please proceed with the analysis and provide the constructed feedback loop for the input video.
```

This prompt ensures that the video editing feedback loop is well-structured, addressing potential quality issues while providing clear avenues for team collaboration through analysis and feedback collection.</pre>
