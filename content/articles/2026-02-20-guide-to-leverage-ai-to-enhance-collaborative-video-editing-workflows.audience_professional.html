<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">Sure! To create a streamlined guide for editing a promotional video using Descript, we'll break it down step by step, taking into account your footage analysis and narrative editing.

### Step-by-Step Editing Guide

1. **Analyze the Raw Footage**:
   - Check for visual quality (lighting, framing, stability).
   - Evaluate audio quality (clarity, background noise).
   - Identify the main themes or messages conveyed.

2. **Identify Key Narrative Elements**:
   - Determine the core objectives: What message is the promotional video trying to convey?
   - Highlight compelling visuals or quotes that stand out.
   - Note any sections that may need more context or explanation.

3. **Constructing the Prompt for Descript**:
   - Gather specific feedback based on the analysis of footage.
   - Prepare to format suggestions clearly for editing.

### Example of a Prompt for Descript

#### Prompt #2:
```
I need assistance with editing a promotional video based on the following observations:

- **Visual Quality**: 
  - The lighting is poor in sections 3:10–3:50. Suggest adjustments to brightness and contrast.
  - Consider adding stabilization for shaky sections at 1:20–1:30.

- **Content to Cut**: 
  - There are irrelevant discussions from 2:00–2:30 that can be removed to maintain focus.
  - Shorten the intro (0:00–0:15) for quicker engagement.

- **Audio Quality**: 
  - The audio quality drops at 4:00–4:10; recommend noise reduction and a volume boost.
  - Add subtitles for key statements at 1:45 and 3:15 for clarity.

- **Enhancements Needed**: 
  - Integrate a call-to-action at the end and emphasize it with text overlay.
  - Suggest adding background music to enhance emotional impact, especially during transitions.

Let me know if you need further details or adjustments!
```

### Notes on Edge Cases:
- If you notice poor lighting, Descript provides options for visual enhancements that can be applied.
- Be vigilant on cutting out any irrelevant content to streamline the narrative.
- For any audio issues, always check options for enhancement within Descript, and potentially propose script changes if context necessitates.

If any part of this guide requires clarification or additional detail to tailor it to your specific footage, please let me know!</pre>
