    <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">Human → Prompt #1 (to AI chat) → AI returns ready-to-use Prompt #2 or questions or instruction → Human (paste Prompt #2 into AI chat or follow the instructions given)</pre>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Try it yourself: Build your own AI prompt</h3>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Here is the input (Prompt #1) ready to use with <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a> (General AI chat).</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">**Role:** You are a data scientist specializing in influencer marketing analytics.
**Objective:** To accurately assess the effectiveness of various social media influencer campaigns.
**Task:** Please create a prompt that will assume achieving the Goal using the tools listed in the Recommended tools section, to analyze influencer performance metrics.
**Chain of thought:** Think step by step: first analyze the input data, then identify the key variables, then construct the prompt for the target tool.
**Output specification:** The output must always be Prompt #2: a ready-to-paste prompt for the chosen tool from the Recommended tools. Describe the exact format (numbered steps, copy-paste block) so that the AI returns Prompt #2.
**Edge cases:** If the input contains mixed languages, ensure translation occurs before analysis; if the dataset exceeds 1000 rows, segment the data for analysis; if the influencer's social media account is inactive, flag this for review.
**Recommended tools:** Opus Clip, Make, Descript.
**Uncertainty:** If you are unsure about any element, please state so and ask for clarification.
**Permission:** If context is insufficient, please ask clarifying questions.</pre>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Here is example output the AI can produce. You may continue in the same chat thread or follow the workflow below using the indicated tools: <a href="https://www.opus.pro/?via=d9d7c5">Opus Clip</a> (AI short-form clips from long videos), <a href="https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=flowtaro">Make</a> (Visual automation and integrations), Descript. and <a href="https://www.descript.com">Descript</a> (Descript is a tool that allows users to edit audio and video by manipulating text transcripts.).</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">To create an effective prompt for analyzing influencer performance metrics, let's follow a structured approach. The first step is to ensure we have the right data and identify key variables that will help assess the effectiveness of the influencer campaigns.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Data Analysis:** 
   - Ensure the dataset includes metrics such as engagement rate, reach, impressions, follower growth, conversion rates, and any qualitative data like comments or sentiments.
   - Check for any mixed languages in the dataset and translate where necessary.
   - Verify if the number of rows exceeds 1000 and, if so, plan to segment the data accordingly.
   - Identify if any influencer accounts are marked inactive and flag those for review.

2. **Identify Key Variables:** 
   - Engagement Rate: Measures the interaction level of followers with the influencer’s posts.
   - Reach: Total unique accounts that saw the influencer's content.
   - Impressions: How many times the content was displayed.
   - Conversion Rate: Tracks the actions taken as a direct response to influencer promotions.
   - Sentiment Analysis: Evaluates public sentiment towards the influencer's campaigns.

3. **Construct the Prompt for the Target Tool:**
   - Choose a tool suitable for analyzing the metrics — for instance, using `Make` to visualize trends based on the collected data.

### Prompt Construction:

Here is how to format the prompt for the chosen tool, assuming we will use Make to analyze the influencer campaigns based on the criteria we defined.

**Prompt #2:**

```plaintext
1. Import the influencer campaign dataset. Ensure it includes metrics such as engagement rate, reach, impressions, follower growth, and conversion rates. 
2. Translate any mixed-language data to English for consistency.
3. If the dataset exceeds 1000 rows, segment the data into manageable batches (e.g., by campaign or date).
4. Flag any influencers whose accounts are marked inactive for review before analysis.
5. Use the following parameters to analyze the dataset:
   - Calculate the average engagement rate across all campaigns.
   - Identify the top 5 campaigns with the highest reach and impressions.
   - Analyze the conversion rates and calculate the ROI for each influencer.
   - Perform sentiment analysis on the comments section to understand public perception.
6. Present the findings in a visual format, creating charts and reports for easy interpretation.
