<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Email marketing remains a powerful tool for businesses to engage with their audience. However, the success of email campaigns often hinges on how effectively lists are segmented. In this article, readers will learn how to leverage AI to automate the segmentation of their email lists, improving targeting and performance of their marketing efforts.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What you need to know first</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Before diving into automation, it's essential to understand a few key concepts related to email segmentation and the role AI plays in refining this process. Segmentation involves dividing your email list into distinct groups based on shared characteristics such as demographics, behavior, and engagement levels. AI can analyze large datasets quickly, revealing patterns that might otherwise be overlooked.</p>
