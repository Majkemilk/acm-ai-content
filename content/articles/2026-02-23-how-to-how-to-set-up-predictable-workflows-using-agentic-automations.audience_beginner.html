<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Here is the input (Prompt #1) ready to use with <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> (General AI chat).</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">Sure! Below is a structured prompt detailing the steps to implement an efficient lead-follow-up email automation using Make and Descript.

### Lead-Follow-up Email Automation Prompt

1. **Define Lead Stages**:
   - Identify the stages of the lead journey (e.g., New Lead, Follow-Up, Qualified Lead, Lost Lead).
   - Document criteria for moving leads between stages.

2. **Configure Make**:
   - Log into your Make account.
   - Create a new scenario for lead tracking.

3. **Connect Lead Sources**:
   - Add HTTP/Webhooks module in Make to capture lead data from your website or landing page.
   - Connect CRM (like Salesforce or HubSpot) to Make for seamless data import.

4. **Set Up Triggers**:
   - Create a trigger for new leads entering the system.
   - Set conditions (e.g., specific content downloaded, form filled) to launch follow-up sequences.

5. **Design Email Templates in Descript**:
   - Open Descript and create personalized email templates for each lead stage.
   - Include dynamic fields (e.g., lead name, company) for personalization.

6. **Integrate Descript with Make**:
   - Use the Descript integration in Make to automatically fetch the desired email templates.

7. **Schedule Follow-Up Emails**:
   - In Make, add a series of email actions to send follow-ups based on time delays (e.g., 1 day, 3 days, 1 week).
   - Set up different emails for various lead stages (e.g., initial follow-up, query response).

8. **Add Conditional Logic**:
   - Use filters in Make to determine if a lead has responded or moved to the next stage.
   - If a lead responds, stop the follow-up sequence; if not, continue sending emails.

9. **Track and Optimize**:
   - Implement tracking to monitor open rates and responses.
   - Use analytics tools to gather data on follow-up effectiveness.

10. **Test the Workflow**:
    - Run the scenario in Make with test leads to ensure that all steps work as intended.
    - Double-check email formatting and dynamic field integration.

11. **Launch and Monitor**:
    - Activate the automation once testing is successful.
    - Regularly check the performance metrics and tweak the workflow as necessary for improvements.

### Ending Note
Make sure to refine your email content and follow-up timings based on user engagement for better results. If you need any clarification on specific steps or need further details, feel free to ask!</pre>
