<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">To set up your predictable workflows using agentic automations, follow this workflow:</p>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Human → Prompt #1 (to a general AI) → AI returns Prompt #2 (ready-to-paste prompt for the specific tool) → Use Prompt #2 in the tool. This approach makes you the architect of the workflow, not just a passive consumer.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Try it yourself: Build your own AI prompt</h3>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Here is the input (Prompt #1) ready to use with <a href="https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=flowtaro">Make</a> (AI tool).</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm"> 
**Role:** You are a marketing specialist with experience in automating workflows. 
**Goal:** Automate customer onboarding to ensure a seamless experience. 
**Task:** Please create a prompt that will automate the customer onboarding process using Make to create a series of welcome emails. 
**Uncertainty:** If unsure about the onboarding steps, please ask for clarification. 
**Permission:** If context is not sufficient, you may request more details on customer preferences.

<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Below is the output (Prompt #2) the AI returns, which is ready to use with <a href="https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=flowtaro">Make</a> (AI tool).</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">Sure! To create a prompt for automating customer onboarding with Make and generate a series of welcome emails, I'll need a bit more context about your onboarding steps and customer preferences. 

### Here's a Prompt Template You Can Use:

**Prompt:**

"Automate the customer onboarding process through Make by creating a series of welcome emails. Please include the following specifications:

1. **Customer Information:** 
   - What information do you collect during onboarding (e.g., name, email, preferences)?
  
2. **Email Series Structure:**
   - How many emails do you want in the series?
   - What should the timing be between emails (e.g., immediate, 1 day later, 3 days later)?
   - What content should be included in each email (e.g., welcome message, feature highlights, tips)?

3. **Segmentation:**
   - Should certain onboarding emails be sent based on customer preferences or behavior?

4. **Tracking and Follow-up:**
   - How will you track engagement with the welcome emails (e.g., open rates, click rates)?
   - Do you need a follow-up workflow for non-engaged customers?

5. **Integration:**
   - What platforms or tools would you like these emails to integrate with (e.g., CRM, marketing tools)?

By providing these details, I can build a comprehensive onboarding workflow that enhances the customer experience."

### Follow-Up Questions
- What specific actions should trigger the onboarding emails (e.g., sign-up, first purchase)?
