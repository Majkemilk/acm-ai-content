<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">In today’s fast-paced digital landscape, establishing predictable workflows is essential for efficiency and consistency. This guide will walk you through how to set up predictable workflows using agentic automations. You’ll learn about prerequisite concepts, decision-making rules, and practical templates to implement these workflows in your business.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What you need to know first</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Before diving into automations, it's crucial to understand a few key concepts that will help set the stage. Here are the main points:</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">

  <li><strong>Workflows:</strong> A set sequence of tasks or actions that are followed to achieve a specific outcome.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> The ability of automated workflows to produce the same results over time, leading to dependability in business processes.</li>
</ul>
