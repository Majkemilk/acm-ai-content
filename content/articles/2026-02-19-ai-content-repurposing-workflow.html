<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The AI content repurposing workflow is essential for small business marketing leads looking to maximize their content’s lifespan and reach. By efficiently transforming existing materials into various formats, businesses can engage different audience segments and drive more traffic. This approach allows for optimized utilization of time and resources, helping to maintain a consistent presence across multiple platforms. However, it may not be worth pursuing if the original content quality is low or if there are strict compliance requirements involved in content creation.</p>
<h2>What you need to know first</h2>
<ul>
<li>These workflows are most effective when there's a solid inventory of original content, such as articles, podcasts, or videos.</li>
<li>Depending on your team’s size and skills, the complexity of the repurposing process may require additional resources or tools.</li>
<li>Approval processes within your organization can slow down content transformation, impacting the timely execution of campaigns.</li>
<li>Ensure that the repurposed content complies with brand guidelines and legal standards relevant to your industry.</li>
</ul>
<div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-indigo-100 my-6"><h3>Decision rules:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have multiple formats of content (e.g., a blog, video, and infographic), then consider repurposing them to reach different audiences.</li>
<li>If the original content has proven engagement metrics, then prioritize its conversion into new formats instead of creating new content from scratch.</li>
<li>When the turnaround time is tight, then focus on simple repurposing techniques, like creating quote graphics from existing text content.</li>
<li>Avoid repurposing content that is outdated or irrelevant, because it might not resonate with your intended audience.</li>
<li>If your audience prefers shorter formats, then transform long-form content into bite-sized pieces rather than lengthy adaptations.</li>
<li>Do NOT use this workflow if your content frequently requires heavy approvals, as this could delay the repurposing process significantly.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-indigo-100 my-6"><h3>Tradeoffs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Repurposing may require more initial time investment vs. directly creating new content.</li>
<li>While repurposing can expand reach, it may dilute the original message if not done carefully.</li>
<li>Balancing quality vs. quantity can be challenging; focusing on too many formats may compromise the depth of the content.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-indigo-100 my-6"><h3>Failure modes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Failing to track performance metrics from repurposed content can result in wasted effort; set up clear KPIs to evaluate success.</li>
<li>If the content doesn’t align with current audience interests, it will not generate engagement; conduct audience research before repurposing.</li>
<li>Overlooking legal standards in repurposed content could lead to compliance issues; always confirm that new formats adhere to regulations.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-indigo-100 my-6"><h3>SOP checklist:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Review existing content inventory for potential repurposing opportunities.</li>
<li>Define goals for each repurposed piece (e.g., increase engagement, drive website traffic).</li>
<li>Choose appropriate formats based on audience preferences and content type.</li>
<li>Draft new versions or adapt existing scripts for different formats.</li>
<li>Develop an approval workflow to ensure compliance and brand alignment.</li>
<li>Set performance metrics for tracking the success of repurposed content.</li>
<li>Schedule publication and promotion of the repurposed materials.</li>
</ul>
