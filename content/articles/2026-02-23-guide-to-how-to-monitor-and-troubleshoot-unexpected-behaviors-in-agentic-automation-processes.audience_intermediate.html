<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">In today's world of automation, agentic processes are being used to streamline workflows and enhance productivity. However, unexpected behaviors can arise, creating potential disruptions. This guide will help you understand how to monitor and troubleshoot these anomalies in agentic automation processes. You'll learn essential monitoring techniques, practical troubleshooting steps, decision rules, and checklists to effectively manage these challenges.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What you need to know first</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Before diving into the nuances of monitoring and troubleshooting agentic automation, it's essential to grasp a few key concepts:</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
    <li><strong>Agentic Automation:</strong> This refers to automated processes that operate independently to make decisions based on predefined parameters. Understanding their structure is crucial for effective monitoring.</li>
    <li><strong>Workflows:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the flows that the automation follows, as knowing the different paths can help identify where issues occur.</li>
    <li><strong>Metrics and KPIs:</strong> Recognizing the metrics you need to track success and failures. These could include execution time, error rates, and user feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Decision rules:</h2>
