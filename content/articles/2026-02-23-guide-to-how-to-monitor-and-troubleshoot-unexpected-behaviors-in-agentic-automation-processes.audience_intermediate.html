<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">In today's fast-paced automation landscape, unexpected behaviors in agentic automation processes can hinder efficiency and productivity. This guide aims to equip you with the essential skills needed to monitor and troubleshoot these issues effectively. You will learn key concepts, decision-making rules, trade-offs, failure modes, and practical checklists to ensure your automated processes run smoothly.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What you need to know first</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Before diving into monitoring and troubleshooting, it's essential to have a grasp of the foundational elements involved in agentic automation processes. Understanding the following key concepts will enhance your ability to effectively manage automation:</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
    <li>**Agentic Automation**: Automation that incorporates decision-making capabilities, enabling systems to act autonomously based on predefined parameters.</li>
    <li>**Behavior Monitoring Tools**: Software used to analyze the performance of automated workflows by tracking variances and anomalies in execution.</li>
    <li>**Feedback Loops**: Systems in place that allow for continuous monitoring and adjustments based on the performance of the automation processes.</li>
</ul>
