<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">In today's digital landscape, leveraging AI agents in marketing automation is becoming increasingly vital for businesses seeking efficiency. However, with this innovation comes the responsibility of ensuring these agents are monitored for security vulnerabilities. This guide will provide you with essential strategies and frameworks to effectively monitor AI agents, ensuring a secure environment for your marketing operations.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What you need to know first</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Before diving into monitoring AI agents, it's crucial to understand some foundational concepts and prerequisites:</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
    <li><strong>AI Agents:</strong> Software that employs artificial intelligence to make decisions or execute tasks autonomously, such as chatbots or automated email responders.</li>
    <li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities:</strong> Weaknesses that can be exploited by attackers, potentially compromising data integrity or availability.</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring Systems:</strong> Tools and processes that track the behavior of AI agents, analyzing performance and flagging unusual activities that may indicate security issues.</li>
</ul>
