<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">To create an automated marketing performance report by extracting data from Google Analytics and SEMrush, follow these actionable steps:

### Actionable Steps:

1. **Set Up Google Analytics API:**
   - Go to the Google Cloud Console.
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Enable the Google Analytics Reporting API for your project.
   - Create credentials (OAuth client ID) for the API. 

2. **Obtain SEMrush API Access:**
   - Log into your SEMrush account and navigate to the API access section.
   - Generate and save your API key.

3. **Data Extraction with Google Analytics:**
   - Open your data extraction tool (e.g., Make, Data Studio).
   - Connect your Google Analytics account using OAuth credentials.
   - Set the data extraction interval to weekly.
   - Define the reports you want to pull (e.g., user sessions, bounce rates).
   - Schedule the data extraction to happen automatically at the end of each week.

4. **Data Extraction with SEMrush:**
   - Use your SEMrush API key to connect to the API in your data extraction tool.
   - Specify the metrics you want (e.g., keyword rankings, organic traffic).
   - Schedule the data extraction similarly to Google Analytics.

5. **Data Integration:**
   - In your reporting tool (like Descript), integrate the data from both Google Analytics and SEMrush.
   - Ensure that both datasets are aligned (use date range filters as needed).

6. **Create Visualizations:**
   - Utilize graphs, charts, and tables to represent the combined data.
   - Highlight key metrics like traffic growth, bounce rates, and keyword performance.

7. **Automate Report Generation:**
   - Use the features in Make or Descript to automate report generation.
   - Set reporting templates that combine the visualizations and data.
   - Schedule the automated report to be sent to your email or team folder weekly.

8. **Monitor Performance with UptimeRobot:**
   - Set up uptime monitoring for your key web pages.
   - Link uptime metrics into your report to show site reliability as part of performance.

9. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Every month, review the automated reports for accuracy and insight.
   - Adjust data metrics and visualization methods as necessary based on stakeholder feedback.

### Notes:
- Ensure you have proper access rights and configurations set in Google Analytics and SEMrush.
- If you need further clarifications on any tool integration, please provide additional details on the systems you are using or specific metrics of interest.</pre>
