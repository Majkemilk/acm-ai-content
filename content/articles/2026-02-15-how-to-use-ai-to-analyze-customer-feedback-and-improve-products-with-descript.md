## Introduction

Many businesses struggle to make sense of customer feedback effectively. This guide is designed for small business marketing leads seeking to leverage AI for analyzing feedback using Descript. By improving product offerings through insightful analyses, you can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. When this approach is not worth it is when the organization lacks a robust set of feedback channels to analyze.

## What you need to know first

- Ensure you have a reliable source of customer feedback, such as surveys, social media comments, or customer service interactions.
- Feedback must be sufficiently detailed and varied to allow for meaningful analysis.
- Approval from relevant stakeholders is required to act on the data insights.
- Time constraints may exist, especially with fast-paced product updates.
- Compliance with privacy regulations is essential when handling customer data.

## Main content

### Decision rules:

- If your product receives more than 100 pieces of feedback weekly, then prioritize automated analysis tools like Descript for efficiency.
- When feedback contains qualitative data (comments, open-ended responses), use AI to extract sentiment trends and key themes.
- Avoid manual analysis when time constraints limit quality insights because it may result in missed opportunities.
- If customer feedback has fluctuated over time, establish a historical baseline before analyzing current sentiments to avoid skewed results.
- Use visualization tools within Descript to present feedback data compellingly, if team presentations or reports are needed.
- Do NOT use Descript when compliance with data protection regulations hasn't been met, as this can lead to legal risks.

### Tradeoffs:

- Automated vs. manual analysis: Automated solutions can save time but may miss nuanced insights.
- Comprehensive analysis vs. timely action: Taking time to analyze deeply may delay product updates.
- Dependency on technology vs. intuitive understanding: Relying purely on AI might overlook team insights that come from experience.

### Failure modes:

- If customer feedback is not diverse enough, then AI analysis may yield insufficient insights, leading to misalignment with customer needs.
- Misconfigured settings in Descript could result in incomplete data analysis, meaning crucial feedback trends might go unnoticed.
- Relying too heavily on AI models without human oversight could lead to errors in understanding tone, sentiment, or humor in feedback, resulting in misguided adjustments.

### SOP checklist:

- Gather and consolidate customer feedback from various channels.
- Import feedback data into Descript for analysis.
- Choose the appropriate AI analysis tools within Descript.
- Set parameters for sentiment analysis based on key themes.
- Review AI-generated insights with relevant stakeholders for alignment.
- Create visualizations to present findings clearly.
- Develop action items based on insights gained.
