## Introduction

Managing a consistent social media presence can be challenging, especially for a small business marketing lead with limited time and resources. Automating your social media posting schedules with AI, particularly using Otter, can significantly enhance your workflow and save you precious hours each week. This guide will walk you through the intricate steps of setting up automated posting, ensuring you maintain engagement while reducing manual effort. If your team lacks the capacity for constant content updates and rapid approval processes, this approach may not yield the desired effectiveness.

## What you need to know first

- Be aware of your content approval process; delays can disrupt your posting schedule.
- Ensure that the quality of your source material is high; poor content can lead to negative engagement.
- Consider the platforms you're using; not all social media channels have the same audience or engagement patterns.
- Familiarize yourself with Otter’s functionalities to maximize your automation capabilities.

## Main content

### Decision rules:

- If you have several posts ready for the week, then you can efficiently schedule them through Otter.
- When your team is short on time due to impending deadlines, prioritize automating routine posts.
- If local regulations impact content publication, then ensure compliance checks are completed before scheduling.
- Avoid using automated systems when you need to engage in live discussions or responses because timely interaction may decline.
- If you're posting multiple times daily, maintain a flexible schedule and adjust according to audience engagement.
- Avoid automation when significant changes in strategy or messaging are underway, as this could confuse your audience.

### Tradeoffs:

- Automation provides consistency vs. personalized engagement; automated posts may not respond to real-time trends or comments.
- Using AI for scheduling can save time vs. sacrificing quality control; ensure thorough checks before content goes live.
- Scheduled content may lead to a static feed vs. dynamic content; be mindful of platform engagement analytics.

### Failure modes:

- Content that doesn't meet your audience's expectations might lead to decreased engagement; regularly review analytics to adjust strategies.
- Technical issues with Otter could interrupt posting schedules; always have a backup plan, such as manual posting.
- If authorization processes are not followed, scheduled posts might be rejected; verify compliance with team members.

### SOP checklist:

- Determine the content type and target platforms.
- Create and review content with relevant team members for approval.
- Input content into Otter and set your desired posting schedule.
- Monitor engagement metrics shortly after posts go live.
- Adjust strategies based on analytics to improve future posts.

## FAQ

1. **How do I ensure my content is compliant with legal requirements?**  
   Regularly consult with your legal team during the content approval process. Consider implementing compliance checks in the workflow.

   First, check your Otter dashboard for errors. If none are found, manually resend the post and identify the issue to prevent future occurrences.

   Yes, you can edit scheduled posts in Otter, but ensure changes are made well in advance to avoid any delays.

4. **How can I effectively monitor engagement on my posts?**  
   Use Otter's analytics tools to track engagement metrics. Set a schedule for regular reviews, such as weekly or bi-weekly, to adjust your strategy based on data.

5. **Is automation suitable for every type of content?**  
   No, avoid using automation for sensitive topics or content that requires real-time engagement. Analyze the nature of your content before deciding.
