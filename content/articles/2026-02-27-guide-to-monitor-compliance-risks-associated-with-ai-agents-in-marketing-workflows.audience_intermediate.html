<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">Certainly! To create a comprehensive prompt for identifying compliance risks in deploying AI agents in marketing, I need a bit more context. Here are some questions to ensure we cover all necessary aspects:

1. **Regulatory Framework:** Are there specific regulations or compliance standards you'll be focusing on (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, FTC guidelines)?
2. **Type of AI Output:** What kind of AI outputs are we assessing (e.g., social media ads, email marketing, personalized content)?
3. **Stakeholders:** Who are the primary stakeholders involved in the compliance review process?
4. **Risk Tolerance:** What level of risk is considered acceptable? Are there specific thresholds for risk that should trigger additional scrutiny?
5. **Historical Data:** Is there existing data on previous compliance breaches in similar AI applications that could inform risk factors?

Please provide this information, and I'll be able to craft a tailored prompt for you.</pre>
