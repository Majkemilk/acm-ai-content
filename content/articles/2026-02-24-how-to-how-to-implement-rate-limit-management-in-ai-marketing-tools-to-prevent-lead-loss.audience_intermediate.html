### Prompt for Identifying Optimal Rate Limits

**Objective:** Analyze historical traffic data to determine optimal rate limits for processing incoming leads. The goal is to ensure no lead is lost while maintaining an efficient processing flow.

#### Instructions:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather historical data on lead traffic, including timestamps for lead submissions, the number of leads per time period (e.g., hourly, daily), and the current processing limits in place.
   - Include any existing data on lead processing outcomes (e.g., successful conversions, drop-offs).

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - **Traffic Patterns:** Use time series analysis to identify peak traffic periods. Determine if there are specific days or hours with higher lead volumes.
   - **Conversion Rates:** Analyze how conversion rates fluctuate with varying lead volumes. Identify any thresholds where conversion efficiency declines.
   - **Processing Speed:** Assess the time taken to process leads during different traffic scenarios. Establish a baseline for processing capabilities.

3. **Rate Limits Proposal:**
   - Based on the analysis, propose new rate limits for lead processing. Consider:
     - Maximum leads per minute/hour based on historical peak traffic.
     - Adjustments during high-traffic periods to prevent bottlenecks (e.g., temporarily increasing limits).
     - Algorithms to dynamically adjust rate limits based on real-time traffic inputs.

4. **Scenario Simulation:**
   - Use simulations to model different traffic scenarios with the new proposed rate limits. 
   - Measure the impact on lead loss and conversion rates.

5. **Implementation Plan:**
   - Detail the steps required to implement the new rate limit protocols.
   - Include monitoring strategies to assess the effectiveness post-implementation.

#### Questions:
- What are the current lead processing limits, and how are they set?
- Are there specific time frames or lead characteristics that consistently show high volume?
- What tools do you currently use for monitoring lead traffic and processing effectiveness?
