## Introduction

Repurposing YouTube videos into blog articles is a valuable strategy for small business marketing leads looking to maximize content effectiveness. By transforming video content into written format, you can enhance SEO, reach new audiences, and reinvigorate your existing content. However, this approach may not be cost-effective when considering the time and effort needed for extensive edits or revisions.

## What you need to know first

- Ensure video content is high-quality, as poor audio or visuals will detract from blog article impact.
- Be aware of approval loops within your organization; securing buy-in may take time and complicate the workflow.
- Familiarize yourself with the specific tone and style of your blog to maintain brand consistency.
- Understand that the length of the video might impact the resultant article's depth; longer videos may require substantial editing for coherence.

## Main content

### Decision rules:

- If the video is under 10 minutes long, then aim to convert it into a 600-800 word article for concise storytelling.
- If the video contains multiple key points, then outline these as separate subheadings in the blog to enhance readability.
- Avoid lengthy videos unless the target audience is specifically seeking in-depth analysis, as this may lead to disengagement.
- If you have limited editing resources, then prioritize summarizing the main ideas rather than creating a detailed script.
- If compliance standards exist for your industry, ensure all content is reviewed by legal before publishing.
- Use AI tools like Descript when quick turnaround times are essential, but avoid it for final content checks to ensure quality.

### Tradeoffs:

- Speed vs. depth: Rapid content generation through AI may sacrifice nuanced insights from the original video.
- Volume vs. quality: Producing multiple articles from a single video can dilute the quality if not properly managed.
- Automation vs. personalization: Automated tools may lack the human touch needed to resonate with your audience.

### Failure modes:

- Failing to maintain the original message can cause confusion among readers; mitigate this by closely following the video's structure.
- Over-reliance on AI tools may produce generic content; ensure sufficient human review for a personal touch.
- Neglecting to include visual elements from the video may result in a lack of engagement; consider embedding images or videos in the article as supplements.

### SOP checklist:

- Review the video to identify key messages.
- Create an outline based on video segments.
- Draft the article using conversational tone, incorporating SEO keywords.
- Edit for clarity and coherence, ensuring it aligns with blog style.
- Include relevant images or video embeds from the original source.
