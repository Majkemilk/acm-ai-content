**Recommended tools:** Make, Google Analytics, Descript.
**Uncertainty:** If unsure about the effectiveness of historical patterns, ask for clarification.
**Permission:** If the context is insufficient, proceed to ask questions to refine the output.</pre>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">The following is sample output from the AI. Continue in the same thread or continue the workflow according to the instructions below using the indicated tools: <a href="https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=flowtaro">Make</a> (Visual automation and integrations), Google Analytics, Descript. and <a href="https://www.descript.com">Descript</a> (Descript is a tool that allows users to edit audio and video by manipulating text transcripts.).</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">To create a prompt that will help forecast the success of an upcoming advertising campaign based on historical data, we will follow a step-by-step approach. This will include analyzing past campaign performance, identifying patterns, and constructing a specific prompt for the Make tool.

### Step 1: Analyze Historical Campaign Data
Before crafting the prompt, we need to ensure we have key metrics from past campaigns, such as:
- Click-through rates (CTR)
- Conversion rates
- Cost per acquisition (CPA)
- Audience demographics
- Timing and duration of the campaigns

### Step 2: Identify Patterns
We will look for trends in the historical data, such as:
- Seasonal variations (e.g., performance during holidays vs. non-holidays)
- Audience engagement levels
- Impact of different advertising platforms

### Step 3: Construct the Prompt for Make
The prompt will leverage insights from Google Analytics and any additional data.

Here’s the ready-to-paste prompt for Make:

```plaintext
Prompt #2:
Analyze the historical advertising campaign data from Google Analytics, focusing on key metrics including click-through rate, conversion rate, and cost per acquisition. Identify any significant trends or patterns related to audience demographics and the timing of previous campaigns. Use this information to forecast the expected performance of the upcoming campaign, adjusting for considerations such as holiday overlaps or unexpected external factors that impacted prior campaigns.

Please provide recommendations on optimizing the upcoming campaign based on these predictions, including potential adjustments in targeting or budget allocation. Include a visual representation of the forecasted outcomes if possible.
```

### Edge Cases to Handle
1. **Incomplete Data:** If the input data is incomplete, provide reasonable estimates based on similar past campaigns to fill in the gaps.
2. **Campaign Overlap with Holidays:** If the campaign duration overlaps with major holidays, adjust forecasts by analyzing historical performance data during those times.
3. **External Factors:** If previous campaigns had unexpected external factors (e.g., economic downturns, viral trends), mention these and consider their potential impact on forecasts.

If you have further details on the specific metrics or data available, please provide those for a more refined prompt.</pre>
