<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Try it yourself: Build your own AI prompt</h3>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">To create AI prompts effectively, follow this structured workflow: Human → Prompt #1 (meta-prompt to a general AI) → AI returns Prompt #2 (ready-to-paste prompt for the specific tool) → Use Prompt #2 in the tool.</p>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Below is the input (Prompt #1), ready to use with <a href="https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=flowtaro">Make</a> (AI tool).</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">
**Role:** You are a data analyst specializing in marketing analytics and budgeting.
**Objective:** Generate actionable insights to optimize marketing spend based on historical data.
**Chain of thought:** Think step by step: first analyze the historical marketing data, then identify trends and spend patterns, then construct a prompt for the target analytics tool.
**Output specification:** Return a detailed list of recommended actions that can be pasted directly into Descript for deeper analysis.
**Edge cases:** If the data has missing values, log those instances; if spending data is inconsistent across channels, highlight discrepancies.
**Uncertainty:** Ask for clarification if specific metrics or timeframes are unclear.
**Permission:** Request further details on any promotions or events impacting the current budgets.

<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">The AI returns the following output (Prompt #2), which is ready to use with <a href="https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=flowtaro">Make</a> (AI tool).</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">To optimize marketing spend based on historical data, we'll follow a structured approach. Here’s a detailed analysis plan and recommended actions for further query in your target analytics tool.

### Step 1: Analyze Historical Marketing Data
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather all historical marketing data, focusing on key metrics such as spend, impressions, clicks, conversions, and ROI across all channels.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Check for missing values in key metrics like spend, impressions, or conversion rates. Log instances of missing data for later review.
     - Example: If any channel has a missing ROI value, note it for reconciliation.

### Step 2: Identify Trends and Spend Patterns
1. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Analyze data over specified timeframes (weekly, monthly, quarterly). Look for seasonal trends in marketing performance (e.g., higher conversions during holiday seasons).

2. **Channel Performance Comparison**:
   - Evaluate performance metrics per marketing channel (e.g., social media, email, PPC).
   - Identify which channels yield the highest ROI and conversions relative to spend.

3. **Budget Allocation Analysis**:
   - Spot discrepancies in budgeting across channels. 
     - Example: If one channel is consistently underperforming despite high spend, consider adjusting the budget toward higher-performing channels.

4. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Analyze the behavior and conversion rates of different customer segments to pinpoint more lucrative target audiences.

### Step 3: Construct a Prompt for Further Analysis
Based on the above steps, here are recommended actions to optimize marketing spend that can be pasted into Descript for deeper analysis:

1. **Address Missing Values**:
   - "Log instances of missing values in conversion rates and ROI. Review and address these gaps by filling in data where possible."
  
2. **Examine Performance Trends**:
   - "Conduct a trend analysis on monthly marketing budget allocations and their corresponding conversion rates. Identify any seasonal patterns and adjust future budgets accordingly."

3. **Channel Performance Insights**:
   - "Generate a report comparing ROI and conversion rates by channel. Highlight any channels that consistently show low performance despite high budgets for further investigation."

4. **Budget Allocation Reevaluation**:
   - "Identify any discrepancies in marketing spend across channels. Recommend reallocating budget towards channels showing higher conversion and engagement rates."

5. **Customer Segment Analysis**:
   - "Analyze marketing performance by customer segments. Identify top-performing segments and strategize targeted campaigns to optimize conversions."

6. **Impact of Promotions/Events**:
   - "Request details on any promotions or events during the analyzed periods that may have impacted marketing effectiveness. Adjust budgets in future campaigns based on these insights."

### Additional Notes
- If there are specific metrics or timeframes you wish to focus on (e.g., last quarter vs. last year), please clarify.
- If there are recent promotions or external factors affecting marketing budgets, please provide those details for a more tailored analysis.
