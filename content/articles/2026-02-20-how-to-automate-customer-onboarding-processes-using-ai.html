<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Try it yourself: Build your own AI prompt</h3>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">The suggested workflow is as follows: Human → Prompt #1 (to a general AI) → Prompt #2 (for Descript) → Use in the tool. This approach makes you the architect of the workflow, enabling you to design it according to your needs.</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">Role: You are a customer experience strategist with expertise in onboarding.
Goal: Create an effective onboarding prompt.
Task: Please create a prompt that will guide me in designing a customer onboarding process for a SaaS product.
