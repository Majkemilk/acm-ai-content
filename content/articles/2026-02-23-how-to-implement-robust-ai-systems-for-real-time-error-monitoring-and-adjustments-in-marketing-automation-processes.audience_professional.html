<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">To create an effective monitoring and reporting solution for marketing campaigns using Descript, Make, and Google Analytics, we’ll follow a structured approach to ensure integration and error monitoring are seamless. Here’s how we can achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Data Analysis**:
   - Identify the key metrics from the email campaigns (e.g., open rates, click rates, bounce rates, unsubscribe rates).
   - Determine if any input data fields are missing, such as campaign IDs or audience segments.
   
2. **Key Variables**:
   - Define engagement thresholds that trigger alerts (e.g., if the open rate drops below 15%).
   - Monitor multiple email lists simultaneously by categorizing them.

3. **Constructing the Prompt**:
   - Create a prompt to automate Descript for reporting while leveraging Make for real-time data retrieval and Google Analytics for tracking engagement.

Prompt #2: 

# Descript Automation Prompt for Email Campaign Monitoring

## Objective: Automate error monitoring and reporting for email campaigns with Descript.

## Steps:
1. **Set Up Google Analytics Integration**:
   - Ensure Google Analytics is connected to track email engagement metrics (open rates, CTR, etc.).
   - Define custom events for each email campaign to monitor engagement.

2. **Use Make for Automation**:
   - Create a scenario in Make to pull engagement data from Google Analytics daily.
   - Use filters to check for:
     - Missing fields (e.g. campaign ID, sender info). Alert if any field is missing.
     - Engagement rate drop below thresholds (e.g., trigger if open rates &lt; 15%).
   - If multiple email lists are monitored:
     - Aggregate data from each list and apply the engagement metrics analysis separately for each list.

3. **Generate Reporting in Descript**:
   - Take the aggregated data from Make and create a new project in Descript.
   - Construct a script that includes the following:
     - Summary of overall engagement metrics.
     - Detailed breakdown by each email list.
     - List of errors or warnings (e.g., "Campaign X has missing fields" or "Campaign Y has low engagement").
   - Trigger audio/video output to summarize and highlight urgent issues.

4. **Review &amp; Feedback Loop**:
   - Set up a feedback loop to automatically alert the marketing team via email if any metrics fall below threshold or highlighted errors are detected.

## Important Considerations:
- Ensure that you perform regular checks on integrations with Google Analytics and Make to maintain data accuracy.
- Adjust engagement thresholds based on historical performance data and campaign objectives.
```

### Additional Considerations
- **If Input Data is Missing**: The scenario in Make should be designed to send alerts when fields are missing so the team can rectify them promptly.
- **If Engagement Rates Fall Below Thresholds**: Predefine escalation paths for immediate alerts to the marketing team.
- **Monitoring Multiple Lists**: Make sure that each list is categorized for reports to ensure clarity when engagement metrics vary.
