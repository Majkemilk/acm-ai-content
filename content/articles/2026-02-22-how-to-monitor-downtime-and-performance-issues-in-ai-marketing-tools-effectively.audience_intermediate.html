   - Measure the percentage of time the tool is operational (should aim for 99.9% uptime).

2. **Response Time**
   - Track average response times for user queries and transactions.

3. **Error Rate**
   - Monitor the rate of errors (e.g., 500, 404 errors) encountered by users.

4. **Load Time**
   - Measure the time it takes for pages or features to load.

5. **Resource Utilization Metrics**
   - CPU and memory usage during peak and off-peak hours.

6. **User Engagement Metrics**
   - Track number of active users, session duration, and feature usage statistics.

7. **API Response Times**
   - Monitor seasonality and responsiveness of API calls.

8. **Data Processing Time**
   - Measure the time taken to process user data and deliver analytics or outputs.

9. **SLA Compliance**
   - Assess adherence to Service Level Agreements regarding response times and issue resolution.

10. **Error Log Analysis**
