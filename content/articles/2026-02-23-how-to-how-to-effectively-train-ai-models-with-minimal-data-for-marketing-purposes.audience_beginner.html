<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">In the world of marketing, leveraging data to train AI models effectively can seem daunting, especially when the available data is limited. This article will guide you through the process of training AI models with minimal data, ensuring you can optimize your marketing strategies without vast datasets. By the end of this guide, you will understand key concepts, workflows, and practical templates to start training your AI models confidently.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What you need to know first</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Before diving into training AI models, it's essential to grasp a few fundamental concepts:</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
    <li><strong>Machine Learning Basics:</strong> Understand that machine learning algorithms improve through experience, primarily from data inputs.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Types:</strong> Familiarize yourself with various types of data you might use, such as structured (numbers, categories) and unstructured (text, images).</li>
    <li><strong>Overfitting and Underfitting:</strong> Recognize these concepts to ensure your model performs well, especially when trained with limited data.</li>
</ul>

4. Customer ID: 004, Age: 35, Gender: Male, Annual Income: cost,000, Purchase Frequency: 15, Average Transaction Value: cost
5. Customer ID: 005, Age: 28, Gender: Non-binary, Annual Income: cost,000, Purchase Frequency: 5, Average Transaction Value: cost

**Expected Outputs:**
- Segmentation of customers into distinct groups (e.g., High Spenders, Frequent Shoppers, Budget Shoppers).
- Key characteristics of each segment (e.g., demographic trends, spending behavior).
- Recommendations for marketing strategies for each customer segment.

Please analyze the input data and generate a comprehensive segmentation model along with actionable insights.
