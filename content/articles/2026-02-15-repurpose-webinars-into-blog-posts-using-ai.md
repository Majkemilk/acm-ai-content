## Introduction

SaaS founders often struggle to maximize the value of their webinars, leaving content untapped and opportunities wasted. By repurposing webinars into blog posts using AI, they can enhance their content strategy and reach a broader audience. This approach not only saves time but also consolidates valuable insights into a more digestible format. However, this method may not be worth it if the original webinar content lacks coherence or engagement, or if there are legal and compliance concerns with the material.

## What you need to know first

- The quality of the webinar recording must be high; poor audio or video can lead to ineffective repurposing.
- Compliance matters, such as obtaining the necessary permissions from guests or speakers, should be addressed upfront.
- The turnaround time for creating blog content from a webinar can vary based on the length and complexity of the original material.
- It is essential to have a clear understanding of the target audience for the blog posts to tailor the content effectively.

## Main content

### Decision rules:

- If the webinar features engaging visuals or graphics, consider including them in the blog post to enhance reader interaction.
- If the audience feedback during the webinar was positive, prioritize incorporating their questions and comments into the written content.
- If time constraints exist, focus on summarizing key points rather than transcribing the whole webinar.
- If you need to maintain consistency across formats, keep a unified voice and style in both the webinar and the blog post.
- Avoid using overly technical language when the webinar was aimed at a general audience because it can alienate readers.
- Avoid repurposing webinars with significant legal implications without prior review to mitigate compliance risks.

### Tradeoffs:

- Summarizing content vs. preserving in-depth discussions – a shorter post may miss valuable insights.
- Speed vs. quality – rapid content generation might compromise thoroughness and meticulous editing.
- Automation tools vs. manual editing – relying solely on AI without a review may lead to errors or misrepresentations of ideas.

### Failure modes:

- Failing to obtain necessary permissions can result in legal issues, so ensure compliance before repurposing.
- Poorly edited content can miscommunicate the original webinar message; establish a rigorous review process.
- Overlooking the target audience may yield irrelevant or unengaging blog posts, so align content with audience preferences.

### SOP checklist:

- Review the webinar recording for key takeaways.
- Identify and address compliance needs related to the content.
- Outline a draft for the blog post based on the webinar highlights.
- Incorporate any audience comments or questions from the webinar.
- Edit and format the blog post for clarity and engagement.
