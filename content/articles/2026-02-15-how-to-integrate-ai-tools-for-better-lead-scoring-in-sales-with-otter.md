## Introduction

Sales teams often struggle with lead scoring, impacting their ability to prioritize prospects effectively. For the small business marketing lead, integrating AI tools like Otter into the sales process can streamline lead evaluation and enhance conversion rates. When this is not worth the effort is when your team lacks sufficient leads to analyze; applying AI in that case might lead to unnecessary complexities.

---

## What you need to know first

- Data quality is crucial; ensure that the data fed into Otter is accurate and up-to-date.
- Approval loops can slow down the lead scoring process; ensure all team members involved are aligned on the criteria used.
- The effectiveness of AI tools like Otter depends on the volume of leads; too few leads may make automation counterproductive.
- Understanding your customer segments will help configure Otter to deliver better insights.

## Main content

### Decision rules:

- If you have at least 50 leads per week, then leverage Otter for real-time scoring.
- If your sales team requires quick turnaround for lead evaluations, then prioritize integrating AI tools like Otter.
- Avoid using AI lead scoring when your team lacks a clear definition of high-quality leads because misalignment can lead to incorrect prioritization.
- When your budget is tight, consider focusing on fewer, high-potential leads instead of integrating full automation.
- If manual processes are still efficient, avoid rushing into AI; transition when existing methods start causing bottlenecks.
- If your lead volume is stable over time, then maintain consistent scoring criteria to leverage Otter effectively without introducing new variables.

### Tradeoffs:

- Using Otter may speed up lead evaluation, but at the cost of nuanced understanding.
- High automation can improve speed but may reduce personalization in communication with leads.
- Relying solely on AI could result in overlooking unique insights that a human analyst might catch.

### Failure modes:

- Incorrect data inputs can lead to poor lead scoring; double-check data accuracy before feeding it into Otter.
- If your team is untrained in interpreting AI-generated insights, they may misapply the recommendations. Offer training sessions.
- Misconfiguration of Otter's scoring criteria can yield misleading scores; ensure ongoing evaluations of scoring systems.

### SOP checklist:

- Define key criteria for scoring leads.
- Train team members on using Otter effectively.
- Import lead data into Otter for analysis.
- Test lead scoring model with a small subset of leads.
- Regularly review and adjust scoring as new insights arise.
