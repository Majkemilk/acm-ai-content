**Prompt #2: Generate Audience Segments and Ad Content**

```
Using Make, analyze the user behavior data collected from our platforms to identify distinct audience segments. Focus on metrics such as page views, time spent on site, purchase history, and behavioral triggers. 

1. Create audience segments based on the following criteria:
   - Demographics (age, gender, location)
   - Engagement level (high, medium, low)
   - Purchase intent (frequent, occasional, dormant)

2. For each audience segment identified, use ChatGPT to help draft compelling ad copy. The ad content should resonate with their specific behaviors and needs, highlighting the features and benefits that are most relevant to each group.

3. Once the segments and ad content are generated, leverage Jasper to create visually appealing ad formats that align with the narrative established in the ad copy. Ensure each format is tailored for the specific platform (e.g., social media, display ads).

Output the audience segments and corresponding ad content in a structured format, including:
- Segment Name
- Description
- Suggested Ad Copy
- Call to Action
- Recommended Ad Type

Execute this process seamlessly to drive high conversions through targeted ads.
