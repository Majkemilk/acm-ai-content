  - Utilize tools like Make to automate the identification of potential vulnerabilities in the AI systems.
  - Run regular scans to assess security weaknesses in the code and configurations.

- **Analyze User Access Controls**:
  - Check who has access to the AI systems and the data they process.
  - Implement role-based access control and minimize permissions based on necessity.

- **Continuous Monitoring**:
  - Set up alert systems to monitor unusual activity or access patterns to the AI agents.
  - Employ Descript for analyzing communication logs and identifying potential security breaches.

- **Evaluate Interaction with External APIs**:
  - Review connections between AI systems and any external APIs.
  - Assess the security measures in place for these integrations and look for potential data leaks.

- **Conduct Security Audits**:
  - Plan periodic security audits of AI systems to evaluate their risk exposure.
  - Document findings and remediate any identified vulnerabilities.

- **User Training**:
  - Develop training programs for team members on best practices for secure handling of customer data in AI environments.
  - Ensure everyone understands the importance of cybersecurity in marketing tasks.
