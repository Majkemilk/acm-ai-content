<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Step-by-step workflow</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Follow this workflow to effectively automate your customer feedback collection:</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
    <li>Determine the feedback goals you want to achieve.</li>
    <li>Choose the appropriate AI tool for survey creation, such as <a href="https://www.opus.pro/?via=d9d7c5">Opus Clip</a> (AI short-form clips from long videos).</li>
    <li>Write engaging survey questions based on your objectives.</li>
    <li>Set up automated distribution through your chosen platform.</li>
    <li>Collect responses and set alerts for incoming feedback.</li>
    <li>Analyze the feedback using AI-driven insights.</li>
    <li>Make necessary changes to your product or service based on the feedback.</li>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Try it yourself: Build your own AI prompt</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">The workflow is as follows: Human → Prompt #1 (to a general AI) → AI returns Prompt #2 (ready-to-paste prompt for the specific tool) → Use Prompt #2 in the tool. Here’s how to structure your prompt:</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Here is the input (Prompt #1) ready to use with <a href="https://www.opus.pro/?via=d9d7c5">Opus Clip</a> (AI tool).</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">**Role:** You are a customer feedback specialist with experience in survey automation.
**Goal:** To automate the collection of customer feedback efficiently.
**Task:** Please create a prompt that will gather customer feedback effectively through an AI tool.
**Uncertainty:** If you have questions about the audience or desired insights, please ask.
**Permission:** If you need more details about the specific customer segment, please clarify.</pre>
    
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Below is the output (Prompt #2) the AI returns, which is ready to use with <a href="https://www.opus.pro/?via=d9d7c5">Opus Clip</a> (AI tool).</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">To create an effective prompt for gathering customer feedback through an AI tool, I would need a few details:

1. **Target Audience:** Who are we collecting feedback from (e.g., new customers, repeat customers, specific demographics)?
  
2. **Focus Areas:** Are there specific aspects you want to evaluate (e.g., product satisfaction, customer service experience, website usability)?

3. **Preferred Feedback Format:** Do you want quantitative ratings (e.g., 1 to 5 scale) or qualitative responses (open-ended questions)?

4. **Goals of the Feedback:** What insights are you hoping to gain? For example, improving services, identifying pain points, or understanding customer needs.

5. **Frequency of Feedback Collection:** Is this a one-time survey, or will it be ongoing?

Once I have this information, I can draft a tailored prompt for your needs!</pre>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Action cue: Now produce your tailored output by using Prompt #2 in the AI tool.</p>
</ol>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">When NOT to use this</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Avoid using automated feedback collection when dealing with sensitive topics where personal interaction may yield better insights. In circumstances where immediate, qualitative feedback is crucial, manual methods might be more effective.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">FAQ</h2>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
    <li><strong>Can I use free tools for automating feedback?</strong> Yes, many free tools offer basic automation features, but premium options often provide better insights.</li>
    <li><strong>How often should I collect feedback?</strong> Regular collection is advised, but it can depend on your business needs; monthly feedback can be a good starting point.</li>
