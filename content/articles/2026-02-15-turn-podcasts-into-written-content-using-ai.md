## Introduction

Turning podcasts into written content can be a challenge for small business marketing leads who need to expand their content output while maintaining quality. This process allows for the amplification of audio messages into written formats, enhancing visibility and engagement. However, it is essential to consider whether the effort aligns with your content strategy or available resources, specifically regarding time and team approvals.

When this is not worth it: If you lack a clear audience strategy or have minimal raw audio material, pursuing this method may lead to wasted resources.

## What you need to know first

- The quality of the original audio affects the written output; poor sound quality may complicate transcription accuracy.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to use the podcast content, especially if it’s not your own.
- Review team approval processes to avoid delays in post-production or content usage.
- Familiarize yourself with the AI tools available for content generation and ensure they meet your standards.
- Your workflow should accommodate the volume of podcasts you intend to convert within your timeline.

## Main content

### Decision rules:

- If your team produces more than three podcasts a month, consider automating transcription with AI.
- If your target audience prefers written content over audio, prioritize written outputs over further audio projects.
- When working under tight deadlines, utilize AI tools like Descript for faster content generation.
- If the podcast covers multiple topics, avoid creating a full transcript and instead summarize the main points.
- If compliance is a concern, ensure all content adheres to brand guidelines before publication.
- Do NOT use automated tools when the podcast includes sensitive or nuanced content, as context may be lost.

### Tradeoffs:

- Using AI for transcription can save time vs manual transcription, but may require more editing for accuracy.
- Quick turnaround times with AI tools may reduce the depth of content detail vs a fully manual review process.
- AI-generated summaries can provide broad overviews but may lack the nuance of expert interpretations.

### Failure modes:

- Poor audio quality can lead to inaccuracies in AI-generated transcripts; make sure to review outputs thoroughly.
- Misinterpretation of context in transcripts can lead to errors; always cross-check with the original audio.
- Relying too heavily on AI may result in inauthentic voice without proper human editing; ensure a personal touch remains.

### SOP checklist:

- Identify the podcast episodes you wish to convert.
- Obtain necessary permissions for content use.
- Use AI tools to transcribe audio to text.
- Edit transcripts for accuracy and flow.
- Summarize key points for distribution across channels.
- Seek team feedback and approval before publishing.
- Publish and promote the content across relevant platforms.

## Step-by-step workflow (practical)

1. Select the podcasts you want to convert based on relevance and content quality.
2. Obtain permissions for using the audio content if it’s not originally yours.
