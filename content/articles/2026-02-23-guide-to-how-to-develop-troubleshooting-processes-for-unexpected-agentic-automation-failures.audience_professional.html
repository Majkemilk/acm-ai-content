<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">In the realm of automation, unexpected failures can disrupt operations and hinder productivity. This guide to develop troubleshooting processes for unexpected agentic automation failures is designed to equip professionals with a structured approach to identifying, diagnosing, and resolving automation issues effectively. Readers will learn essential concepts, decision frameworks, trade-offs involved, and practical templates that can be adapted to their specific automation needs.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What you need to know first</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Before diving into troubleshooting processes, it's crucial to understand key concepts surrounding agentic automation. Agentic automation refers to systems autonomously executing tasks and making decisions, often based on predefined rules. The following prerequisites will help you grasp the context better:</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
  <li>Familiarity with automation tools and their capabilities.</li>
  <li>Understanding of data integrity and its role in automation.</li>
  <li>Knowledge of basic troubleshooting methodologies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Decision rules:</h2>

**Role:** You are a specialist in troubleshooting automation systems, focusing on incident resolution and process optimization. 
**Objective:** Reduce incident recovery time by 50% within the next quarter. 
**Task:** Please create a prompt that will assume achieving the Goal using the tools listed in the Recommended tools section, to analyze the incident report data and suggest system optimizations. 
**Chain of thought:** Think step by step: first analyze the incident report data, then identify the key patterns and causes, then construct actionable steps for the target tool. 
**Output specification:** Output must always be Prompt #2: a structured incident report in markdown format with sections for incident description, root cause analysis, and recommended action steps. 
**Edge cases:** 
1. If the incident involves multiple systems, summarize the findings for each system. 
2. If the data is incomplete or contradictory, request additional information. 
3. If an urgent incident occurs, escalate it immediately. 
**Recommended tools:** Make, Descript. 
**Uncertainty:** If the AI is unsure about any element, it must state so and ask for clarification. 
**Permission:** If context is insufficient, the AI should ask clarifying questions.
