<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">In the rapidly evolving landscape of automation, failures can disrupt workflows and impede progress. This guide focuses on developing robust troubleshooting processes for unexpected agentic automation failures. You'll learn key strategies to identify, analyze, and resolve issues effectively, ensuring that automated systems work as intended.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What you need to know first</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Before diving into troubleshooting processes, it's essential to grasp some foundational concepts:</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
    <li><strong>Agentic Automation:</strong> This refers to automation systems with a degree of autonomy, making decisions based on pre-defined rules or machine learning models.</li>
    <li><strong>Failure Modes:</strong> Understanding the various failure modes of automation—system errors, connectivity issues, algorithm biases, etc.—enables you to proactively mitigate risks.</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring and Logging:</strong> Keeping detailed logs and constant monitoring can help identify anomalies as they occur, enabling quicker resolution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Decision rules:</h2>
<div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-indigo-100 my-6">
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">When to use this approach:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>If automation failures are impacting key business processes.</li>
        <li>When traditional troubleshooting methods fail or are too slow for the complexity of issues.</li>
        <li>If autonomous decision-making has become a regular feature of your systems.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Tradeoffs:</h2>
<div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-indigo-100 my-6">
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Pros/Cons:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Streamlined workflows, faster problem resolution, improved system reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Initial setup can be resource-intensive, requires ongoing monitoring and adjustments.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Failure modes:</h2>
<div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-indigo-100 my-6">
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">What can go wrong and how to avoid it:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Algorithm Drift:</strong> Over time, machine learning models may become less effective. Regularly retrain models with updated data to mitigate this.</li>
        <li><strong>Connectivity Issues:</strong> Automation that relies on network stability can fail due to outages. Build backup systems and failover mechanisms.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Quality Problems:</strong> Inaccurate or irrelevant data can lead to erroneous decisions. Implement strict data validation checks.</li>
    </ul>

   - **Action:** Document all external dependencies related to the failed automation process (APIs, databases).
   - **Responsible Team:** Systems Architecture Team

2. **Check for Changes**
   - **Action:** Investigate any recent changes to the system architecture, API versions, or dependencies that may have caused the failure.
   - **Responsible Team:** Change Management Team

---

#### Step 2: Review Logs

1. **Collect Logs**
   - **Action:** Gather logs from all relevant sources (application logs, server logs, transaction logs).
   - **Responsible Team:** DevOps Team

2. **Analyze Logs**
   - **Action:** Look for error messages, stack traces, or significant indicators of failure in the logs.
   - **Responsible Team:** Software Development Team

3. **Check for Missing Logs**
   - If logs are missing or incomplete:
     - **Option A:** Use alternative data sources like UptimeRobot for monitoring status.
     - **Option B:** Check system alerts or notifications that may provide insights.
   - **Responsible Team:** Operations Team

---

#### Step 3: Diagnose Issues

1. **Initial Diagnosis**
   - **Action:** Run failure simulation tests to replicate the issue.
   - **Responsible Team:** QA Team

2. **Identify Patterns**
   - **Action:** Determine if the failure is recurrent or a one-off incident. Consider frequency, triggers, and conditions.
   - **Responsible Team:** Analytics Team

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - **Action:** Dive deep into identified patterns and logs to confirm root cause.
   - **Responsible Team:** Specialized Support Team (e.g., Database or API specialists)

---

#### Edge Case Handling

**If the failure reoccurs:**
- **Step 1:** Document additional evidence including date, time, and activity leading up to the failure.
- **Step 2:** Conduct a brainstorming session with impacted teams to reconsider potential causes.
- **Step 3:** Implement fail-safes or modified approaches to tuple issues identified.
- **Responsible Team:** Cross-Functional Team

---

#### Additional Clarifications Needed: 
- Please specify the type of automation process that has failed (e.g., ETL, CI/CD, etc.).
- What specific errors or symptoms are being observed upon failure?

This plan aims to ensure that all aspects of the failure are addressed, and the responsible team members are clear on their specific roles in the troubleshooting process.</pre>
