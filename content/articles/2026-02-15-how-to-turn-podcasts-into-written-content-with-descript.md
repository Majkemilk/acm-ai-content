## Introduction

Many small business marketing leads struggle to convert valuable podcast content into written formats, which can limit their audience reach. By using Descript, these professionals can efficiently transform audio into written content, unlocking new channels for engagement. This approach can generate more website traffic, enhance SEO, and diversify the content portfolio. However, if you're dealing with multiple podcast episodes weekly, it may become overwhelming to manage the workload without adequate resources.

## What you need to know first

- The quality of the podcast audio significantly affects the transcription accuracy.
- Approval loops with stakeholders can extend timeframes for content release.
- It’s essential to review transcriptions for context and tone adjustments.
- A clear outline of the intended written content format (blog post, article, etc.) will guide the transcription editing process.
  
## Main content

### Decision rules:

- If your team publishes 2–3 podcast episodes per week and needs to create related written content quickly, prioritize automation tools like Descript.
- When the content quality in transcriptions is crucial, avoid overly complex audio clips, as they can lead to significant transcription errors.
- If your podcast episodes cover intricate topics, plan to allocate additional editing time for clarity.
- If you require team approvals for final content, factor in potential delays due to coordination and feedback cycles.
- Avoid using Descript if your audio files are of low quality, as this will result in inaccurate transcriptions.
- If you have a tight deadline but need high-quality content, consider splitting the workload among team members or using additional editing software for refinement.

### Tradeoffs:

- Using Descript may expedite the transcription process at the cost of needing additional editing time to ensure quality.
- Automating transcription may reduce manual effort but could lead to nuances and context being lost in the process, necessitating a thorough review.
- Speeding up content output can sometimes sacrifice depth and analysis in the written form.

### Failure modes:

- Misunderstandings can occur if audio quality is poor; ensure to use clear audio files to mitigate this risk.
- Incomplete transcriptions may result from interruptions, which can hinder the overall content quality. Mitigate by reviewing audio for continuous quality before starting.
- Failure to account for revisions during the transcription process can lead to missed deadlines; create a realistic timeline that includes editing.

### SOP checklist:

- Identify the podcast episode to transcribe.
- Upload audio files into Descript.
- Review and edit the initial transcription for accuracy.
- Decide on the format for written content (blog post, article, etc.).
- Finalize and format the written content according to brand guidelines.
- Share the draft for team feedback and approvals.
- Publish the final content across selected platforms.
