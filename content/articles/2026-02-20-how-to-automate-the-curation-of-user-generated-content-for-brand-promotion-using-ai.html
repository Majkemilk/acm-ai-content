<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">In the age of digital marketing, user-generated content (UGC) has emerged as a potent tool for brand promotion. This article will guide you through how to automate the curation of user-generated content for brand promotion using AI. You will learn about essential prerequisites, decision rules for implementation, and practical templates to kickstart your AI-driven approach.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What you need to know first</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Before diving into automation, it’s crucial to understand key concepts surrounding UGC and AI tools.

AI tools can streamline the collection, analysis, and repurposing of this content, making it a breeze to enhance your brand's visibility and credibility.</p>
