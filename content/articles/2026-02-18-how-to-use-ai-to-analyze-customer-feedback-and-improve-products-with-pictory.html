<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Try it yourself: Build your own AI prompt</h3>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">The suggested workflow is as follows: Human → Prompt #1 (to a general AI) → Prompt #2 (for Pictory) → Use in the tool. Use the following meta-prompt to create your own AI prompt:</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">Role: You are a customer feedback analyst with expertise in AI tools.
Goal: Analyze customer feedback to improve product features.
Task: Please create a prompt that will analyze customer feedback sentiment for use in Pictory.
Uncertainty Flagging: If you are unsure about any element, please state so and ask for clarification before proceeding.
Permission to ask clarifying questions: If context is insufficient, you may (and should) ask the user for more details.</pre>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">This structured approach allows you to become the architect of your workflow rather than just a passive consumer.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">When NOT to use this</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Avoid using AI-driven customer feedback analysis if you operate in a niche market with very limited feedback, where qualitative insights may be more valuable than quantitative data. Additionally, if the feedback is primarily non-verbal (e.g., video content), using AI without adaptation may not yield meaningful results.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Case study</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">A mid-sized consumer electronics company, HomeGadget, utilized <a href="https://pictory.ai/">Pictory</a> to analyze customer feedback collected from their latest product launch. Initially overwhelmed by customer reviews and social media mentions, they turned to Pictory’s sentiment analysis capabilities. Within weeks, they identified that 70% of the feedback was positive, but a recurring theme focused on the lack of integration with smart home systems.</p>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Armed with this insight, HomeGadget's product development team was able to prioritize a software update that improved compatibility with leading smart home devices. As a result, customer satisfaction ratings increased by 35% in the following quarter, and sales surged by 20%, confirming the value of leveraging AI for actionable insights.</p>
