<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">To create effective and tailored content, consider this workflow: Human → Prompt #1 (to a general AI) → Prompt #2 (for a specific tool, e.g., Descript) → Use in the tool. Here's how to structure your prompts:</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">Role: You are a content strategist familiar with podcast content.
Goal: Create an engaging article based on a podcast episode about AI in marketing.
Task: Please create a prompt that will analyze the transcribed podcast content and summarize key points effectively.
Uncertainty Flagging: If you aren’t sure about any part of the podcast, clearly state that and ask for clarification.
