1. **Input Data Verification**: Review the available engagement data across email, social media, and website interactions. Ensure data integrity by confirming that all channels have been properly tracked and documented.

2. **Data Clarification**: If discrepancies are detected (e.g., mismatched email open rates or social media engagement levels), please provide additional details or clarification regarding the source of these metrics.

3. **Identify Key Variables**:
   - Email Engagement Metrics (open rates, click-through rates, conversion rates)
   - Social Media Interaction Metrics (likes, shares, comments, follower growth)
   - Website Metrics (bounce rates, session durations, page views, cart abandonment)

4. **Construct Analysis Prompt**:
   - Using **Make**, create a workflow to analyze the engagement data collected:
     - "Gather email engagement metrics from [specific email platform], social media metrics from [specific social platform], and website analytics from [specific website analytics tool]."
     - "Combine this data to identify trends over the last [specific time period]."
     - "Output key insights on how each channel contributes to retention rates and identify any patterns that could suggest potential improvements in user engagement."

5. **Language Consideration**: Specify which language(s) the analysis will cover, ensuring that any cultural or regional nuances are applied in the interpretation of the data.

6. **Next Steps**: If the analysis extends beyond typical engagement metrics, please indicate which additional metrics or dimensions (e.g., customer feedback or demographic information) you would like to include in the analysis.

Please confirm the project's scope before proceeding, including the specific time periods and any preferred data formats for the output.</pre>
