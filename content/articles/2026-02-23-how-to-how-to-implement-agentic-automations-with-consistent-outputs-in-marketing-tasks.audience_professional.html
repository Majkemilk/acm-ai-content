<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">In today's fast-paced marketing landscape, implementing agentic automations with consistent outputs can significantly streamline operations. This article will guide you through the necessary steps to effectively implement these automations in your marketing tasks, helping you reduce manual workload and improve output quality across campaigns.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What you need to know first</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Before diving into the specifics, it is essential to understand key concepts such as agentic automations, output consistency, and the tools available to achieve this. Agentic automations refer to self-directed systems that make decisions based on predetermined criteria. Output consistency ensures that these decisions lead to uniform results, critical for maintaining brand voice and messaging.</p>
