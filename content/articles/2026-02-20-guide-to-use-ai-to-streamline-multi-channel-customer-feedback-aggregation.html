<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Step-by-step workflow</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
    <li>Identify the channels through which you collect customer feedback.</li>
    <li>Choose AI tools that integrate well with those channels.</li>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Try it yourself: Build your own AI prompt</h3>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">To create a personalized feedback aggregation system, follow this workflow: Human → Prompt #1 (to a general AI) → Prompt #2 (for the specific tool, e.g., Descript) → Use in the tool. Here’s how to structure your initial prompt:</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto text-sm">
Role: You are a customer feedback analyst with experience in multi-channel aggregation.
Goal: To streamline the aggregation of customer feedback from various platforms.
Task: Please create a prompt that will analyze customer feedback from email surveys, social media and product reviews.
Uncertainty Flagging: If you are unsure about any element, please state so and ask for clarification before proceeding.
Permission to ask clarifying questions: If context is insufficient, please ask me for more details.
</pre>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">When NOT to use this</h2>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Avoid using AI for feedback aggregation when you have a low volume of feedback data, as the overhead may outweigh the benefits. Likewise, if customer sentiment requires a high degree of nuance that cannot be captured by AI algorithms, consider manual analysis methods.</p>
